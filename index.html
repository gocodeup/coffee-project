<!--TODO
Update the HTML

Tables are a little old school, you need to refactor the code so that each coffee is displayed in a div that
contains a heading displaying the coffee name, and the type of roast in a paragraph. Don't display the ids,
these are only for our application's internal use

When the page loads, the coffees should be sorted by their ids in ascending order

Add functionality to search through the coffees by name, and display only the coffees that match the provided
search term (You will need to add an input field to the existing form for this)

Add functionality to update the displayed coffee as the user types into the search box, or as soon as they
select an option from the select.
