******** TO DO LIST ***************

1. Display each type of coffee inside its own div
    - div's need to display name and type of roast
    - hide the id's for internal use only

2. When the page loads, the coffees should be sorted by their ids in ascending
   order

3. Add functionality to search through the coffees by name, and display only the
   coffees that match the provided search term (You will need to add an input
   field to the existing form for this)

4. Add functionality to update the displayed coffee as the user types into the
   search box, or as soon as they select an option from the select.

   /*---Bonus--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

1. Add an option to select all roasts for roast type

2. Make your name search case insensitive

3. Create another form on the page that has an input for the coffee name, and
   a select to choose the coffee roast. When the form is submitted, the new
   cofee should appear on the page. (*Note that any new coffees you add will
   be lost when you refresh the page, for an extra challenge, research


/*--styling---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

4. The page looks pretty plain as it is, and the refactoring we did above to
   use `div`s for coffees should give us more flexibility in styling. (*Hint:
   the styling shown in the example below can be achieved purely with bootstrap
   classes, that is, without custom CSS*)
